Cost of sales decreased primarily due to decreased cost per pound sold and sales volume of $309.8 million, or 3.3 percentage points, and $129.6 million, or 1.3 percentage points, respectively. The decrease in cost per pound sold was driven by a reduction in feed ingredients, such as corn and soy, costs in our live operations. The reduction in live operations costs was partially offset by an increase in labor, incentive compensation, and insurance costs.\n",

These include financial risks such as a substantial amount of debt, the potential negative impact of declining metals prices, and possible write-downs due to various operational or market factors. Operational risks mentioned are those associated with inadequate infrastructure and hazards inherent to the mining industry that may not be fully covered by insurance. Furthermore, the company faces risks related to credit rating downgrades increasing borrowing costs, substantial costs from mine closure and reclamation regulations, potential environmental liabilities, and the subordination of existing stockholders to senior noteholders.\n",
