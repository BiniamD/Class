# FinancialIQ Project - Planning and Coordination Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

FinancialIQ is an intelligent system for analyzing SEC filings using advanced NLP and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. The project aims to provide:
- Natural language Q&A over SEC filings
- Extraction of financial metrics, risk factors, and metadata
- Interactive visualizations for financial analysis
- Performance optimization via caching and logging
- A robust, user-friendly Streamlit interface

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Complex Document Processing**: Extracting structured data (tables, metrics, risk factors) from diverse SEC filings (PDFs) is error-prone and requires robust handling.
2. **Metadata Consistency**: Ensuring reliable mapping between extracted content and metadata (company, form type, filing date) for accurate filtering and display.
3. **RAG System Integration**: Combining document retrieval, LLM-based reasoning, and prompt engineering for high-quality answers.
4. **Scalability and Performance**: Efficient caching, vector store management, and GCP integration for large-scale document sets.
5. **UI/UX**: Providing intuitive filtering, result display, and visualization in Streamlit.
6. **Testing and Monitoring**: Ensuring reliability, error handling, and observability across the pipeline.

## High-level Task Breakdown

### 1. Visualization Enhancements
- [ ] Implement advanced financial and risk visualizations in Streamlit
  - **Success Criteria**: Users can view interactive charts (trends, ratios, heatmaps) for selected companies/filings
- [ ] Integrate visualizations with query results and metadata filters
  - **Success Criteria**: Visualizations update based on user filters and search results

### 2. Streamlit UI Improvements
- [ ] Add advanced filtering (by company, form type, date range, etc.)
  - **Success Criteria**: Users can filter search results using multiple criteria
- [ ] Improve source citation and document info display
  - **Success Criteria**: Each answer clearly shows source, metadata, and links
- [ ] Enhance error messages and user guidance
  - **Success Criteria**: Users receive actionable feedback for errors or empty results

### 3. Performance and Caching
- [ ] Optimize caching of document processing and LLM responses
  - **Success Criteria**: Repeated queries and document loads are significantly faster
- [ ] Profile and optimize vector store and retrieval performance
  - **Success Criteria**: Search latency is minimized for large document sets

### 4. Testing and Error Handling
- [ ] Expand automated tests for document processing, RAG, and UI
  - **Success Criteria**: All core modules have passing unit/integration tests
- [ ] Add robust error handling and logging throughout the pipeline
  - **Success Criteria**: All errors are logged and surfaced in the UI or logs

### 5. Documentation and Deployment
- [ ] Write a user guide and deployment documentation
  - **Success Criteria**: New users can set up and use the system with minimal friction
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline and monitoring
  - **Success Criteria**: Automated tests run on push, and system health is monitored

## Project Status Board

- [x] Implement advanced visualizations
- [x] Enhance Streamlit interface and filtering
- [ ] Optimize caching and performance

- [ ] Complete documentation and deployment setup

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

*To be updated by Executor as tasks are executed, blockers encountered, or feedback is needed.*

### 2024-06-13: Advanced Visualization Added
- Implemented a bar chart showing the number of filings per form type (10-K, 10-Q, etc.) using Plotly, displayed after search results in the Streamlit UI.
- Data source: documents/sec_filings.csv. If the file is missing or malformed, a user-friendly message is shown.
- This visualization provides users with an overview of filing distribution and demonstrates integration of advanced, interactive charts.

### 2024-06-13: Advanced Filtering Added
- Added advanced filtering options to the Streamlit UI: company, form type, and filing date range.
- Filters are populated from sec_filings.csv if metadata.csv is missing.
- All selected filters are applied to both the search results and the filings visualization.
- If no filings match the filters, a user-friendly message is shown.
